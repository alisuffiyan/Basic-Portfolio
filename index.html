        <p> I live in Downey. I graduated with associates of liberal arts and psycholgy from cerritos college. Currently, I am
            working on my bachelor of psychology with online classes at National University. Besides my academics, I am a
            full time employee with access where I work about 40 hours a week. Although I am a psychology major, I have always
            shown an interest in modern technology as it is the trend of the modern age. I have a passion about computer
            science which I didn't know how to approach to. I found this bootcamp class which is really helpful in making
            me to work with the techonoly of our time. </p>
